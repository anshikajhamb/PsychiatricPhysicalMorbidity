//There are 870 participants for whom all the variables are observed. The most common missing data pattern is when all variables but phq9 are observed (n=389). The next most commonly occuring missing data pattern is when all variables but ses are observed (n=204).

//We can see that 53% of our sample is missing at least one variable. 



**complete case analysis 
regress phq pm25 age i._gender ses i._employment i.exercise i._smoker

// the complete case analysis uses 870 rows of data only. The R-squared signifies that the regression model explains ~30% of variance in depression scores ie phq9. For one unit increase in pm25, there is an estimated increase of ~0.26 units in depression scores phq9. This effect is statistically significant (p <0.0001). For one year increase in age, there is an estimated increase of ~0.047 units in depression scores with effect being marginally significant (p =0.045). Compared to reference category male, gender female is associated with a decrease of ~1.04 units in depression scores with effect being statistically significant (p=0.003). Higher socioeconomic measures of deprivation (categories 3,4 and 5) were significantly associated with higher depression scores compared to the reference category 1 (least deprived). Employment status was not significantly associated with higher depression scores. No consistent pattern was observed between different categories of exercise and depression scores. Non-smokers had substantially lower depression scores comapred to smokers (p<0.0001).

**generate a var with value 0 if row has no missing values.

//When conducting a chi-square test to determine whether occurence of missing values is independent of gender, the statistical evidence rejects the null hypithesis of independence (p=0.005), suggesting a statistically significant association between the two. However, this test does not confirm a causal relationship between the two. By running a logistic regression, it can be concluded that gender predicts missingness in the dataset (p=0.005) with the odds ratio suggesting the odds for females being in the excluded category is reduced by approximately 23.24% (ie 1 - 0.7676) compared to males.

//However, missingness was not found to be significantly associated with different levels of socioeconomic levels (p=0.198), employment (p=0.378), smoking(p=0.669), exercise (p=0.494) and borough (p=0.926). Therefore, we can  conclude that only gender predicts the probability of missing data being present or not.
