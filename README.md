A synthetic dataset from a fictional study of psychiatric and physical morbidity study in London .
The study was a cross-sectional survey of 1834 adults aged 16 years and over residing in the 32 London boroughs between 2008 and 2010. The total population size for the 32 boroughs was 7,653,600 (mid-2009 estimate).
The dataset contains the following variables:
pid: Participant numeric identifier 

borough	Borough

age	-Participant age at time of completing the survey 

ses-	Socioeconomic measure of deprivation
1 = Least deprived; 5 = Most deprived. 
employment	-Nature of work (Manual/Office)
gender	-Gender (Female/Male)
exercise	-How many times a week they exercise 
smoker	-Smoking status (Smoker/Non-smoker)
pm25	-Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 mm, annual average concentrations (mg/m3).
phq9	-Depression symptom score
0 = No depressive symptoms; 27 = all depressive symptoms.
Any categorical values not listed above were treated as missing values (e.g., “NA”)


Depression affects around 1 in 6 adults in the UK (Champion Health UK, 2023). The severity of depression results in reduced quality of life, impaired day-to-day functioning and socioeconomic deterioration (Hammer-Helmich et al., 2018; Vos et al., 2015). Air pollution ranks among the top five risks for deaths all over the globe (Cohen et al., 2017). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed associations of PM2.5 and PM10 with depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder and suicide in adults, with more than six months of exposure to pollutants causing severe depression (Braithwaite et. Al., 2019). Studies have suggested both direct and indirect causal links between air pollution and depression. Indirectly, exposure to air pollution can first result in increased risk of developing neurological and physical impairments, cumulatively leading to depression (Qiu et. al., 2023). Outdoor air pollution also limits the amount of time people spend outdoors, reducing physical activity and inducing social isolation, resulting in detrimental effects to mental health (Abu-Omar, 2004). Directly, mechanistic studies have shown that inhalation of air pollutants causes neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular damage (Babadjouni et al., 2017), resulting in onset of depression as a result of neurotransmitter dysregulation. 
In light of these studies, we are interested in studying the effects of air pollution on depression amongst individuals across 32 boroughs in London, UK. Past research has also indicated the effects of low socioeconomic status on increasing the likelihood of depression (Jespersen,2023). We will therefore adjust for socioeconomic status and boroughs while studying the link between air pollution and depression. Although research is scarce, there is also an indication of the combined effect of air pollution and smoking on depression in low and middle-income countries (Borroni, 2022). Our analysis will attempt to contribute to this literature by studying whether the effects of air pollution with mental health depend on smoking among individuals residing in these London boroughs.
